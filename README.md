We explored the design of push notifications on user interruption, user attention, and user perception of notifications attributes by comparing the retention score for information recall and the similarity score for text transcription. We compared 32 participants to determine the effect of font family, background color, duration of visibility, icon reinforcement, and haptic feedback on user performance and perception. Ultimately, the study is the first exploration to provide an all-inclusive approach to user interruption, user attention, and user perception and contribute design insights for future notification delivery and further notification development.
